take the 'tag' from the 6th shoe of each type
or to get the first, take the 1st tag from every 6 shoes

if shoes[shoe]['tag'] == 1 (first shoe in category 1)
     spit out div for category 1
else if shoes... == 7 (first shoe in category 2)
    spit out div for category 2
else if shoes... == 12 (first shoe in category 3)
    spit out div for category 3
    
    
for automatic-ness, detect how many shoes is in that category
if shoes... == "low top"
    lowtop_counter =+1
else if shoes... == "high top"
    hightop_counter =+ 1
etc

then to find out how the first shoe in that category, use the formula:

a = b - c 

Where:
a = shoe 1
b = number of shoes 
c = number of shoes - 1

if shoe[shoes]['category'] == low top
    lowtopCount += 1
else if shoe[shoes]['category'] == high top
    hightopCount += 1

firstLowtop = lowtopCount - (lowtopCount - 1)

if shoe[shoes]['shoeID'] == firstLowtop
    spit out this div




we have 12 shoes, and we want to find the name of the 7th shoe
add up how many shoes there are
add up how many shoes there are in the previous category
there are 6 previous shoes

we take 6 of the 12, which leaves 6 shoes in the right category
12, 11, 10, 9, 8 and 7
we take 12 - (nshoes - 1)
12 - 6
12, 11, 10, 9, 8, which leaves shoe 7

we have 24 shoes, and we want to find the name of the 18th shoe
add up how many shoes there are
add up how many are in the previous category
6 previous shoes
 nah fuck this its too complicated
