i only want shoes in a specific category, leave the rest out
once ive got the list of shoes, i want to display the shoe name and a shoe image with a link to an ID to shoe-detail.html 

ill use jinja and a for loop to print out all the <div>s that make up each 'card' or item in the list on all-shoes.html 

    
    only pass the category to Jinja
    use a for loop via jinja and compare each item in the json list. if it's the category that we want, (the one passed in the url), then great, display that one. 
    
    
    for singleShoe in shoeList:
        if singleShoe[loopCount]['category] = 'Lowtop':
            print '<div> {{ singleShoe[loopCount]['name']} </div>' etc 
        else:
            well, do the next fucking one

that should do it for the category page
